My idea is to create a bookmark manager that is self-hosteable and single-user only.

Why? I am constantly roaming between devices, and for reasons, I can't use the same web browser on all devices (Sync isn't an option).

Often it happens that I need to recall to articles that I read, or documentation websites, and I am lazy to go thro the search engine all over again.

This program allows me to deploy an auth-only website that I can safely access on any device I own to search thro my bookmarks or add more.

# Disclaimer

This program is a work in progress and it's not done.

I made this program for myself, I don't have the intention (for now) to document it and/or give support, so pretty much you are on your own.

This piece of software is barely tested, don't use it on production, or use it on your own risk.
